## TRUTH CLAIM

Characters that are fictional are just and only that - as are their actions. These are fables, stories, and legends. Historical characters that actually lived are true. They, and their actions, are truthful. The Life, Death, Burial and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus are all True Events, not unsubstantiated fables. They exhibit historicity.

## IMPACT, IF IT IS TRUE:

While people can have their own opinions or preferences, those are not truths. The phrase “well, it’s MY truth” is a selfish statement spoken with pride, designed to consciously or unconsciously raise the speaker in importance above all others, above other truths, and above God. Most don’t know they’re doing it, though.

Those who state “all truth is relative” or “there is no absolute truth” are wishfully thinking and simultaneously making a self- defeating statement.
