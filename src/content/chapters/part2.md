## OVERVIEW

Who created God?

Faith and Reason are not mutually exclusive

Philosophical Naturalism

We have a God-sized hole in our hearts; we’re hard-wired that way

## TRUTH CLAIM

There is firm, objective evidence for God.

## IMPACT, IF IT IS TRUE:

There is a God. The idea that there is no God is false. Have faith in this conclusion, because of the evidence.

It might be convenient, freeing, and allow the false assumption that you can do whatever you want and believe whatever you want to believe, but it’s not true. 

But there are many religions out there, claiming many Gods. Is one of them the correct one, or are multiple ones true? One must now dig further to determine if one God (theism), or more than one (pantheism) is correct. If there are conflicts or mutually exclusive beliefs/histories between belief systems, then certain belief systems must fail the test. This can be known. This can be discovered.
